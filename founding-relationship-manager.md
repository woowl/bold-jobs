# Strategic Development Manager

## We Are

- **Small.** We’re a well funded early stage (<4 employees) startup tackling a giant ($50B+) market. We’re supported by the smooth machinery of a Tier 1 startup studio/incubator, which complements our operational needs.
- **Ambitious.** The residential real estate offer process is broken. It's confusing, frustrating, opaque, and complicated – and it’s the largest financial transaction in most people’s lives. We’re injecting it with transparency, technology and long-waited satisfaction, for all parties involved, and establishing a business model which will capture a lot of that value.
- **Thoughtful.** Our core values are transparency and rationality: we’re moving fast, but we’re investing our time wisely; we’re making big bets, but taking deliberate steps. We’ll be diligent in selecting our first designer, but we’ll make sure they are fully set up to succeed.
- **Grounded.** We’re building a business, which means making sure we deliver value for our customers fast. Monetization is not an afterthought, and we don’t depend on network effects for our product to work.
