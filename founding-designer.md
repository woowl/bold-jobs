# Bold’s First Designer

We’re [**Bold**](http://boldlisting.com/), and we’re looking for our first designer.

## **We Are**

* **Small.** We’re a well funded early stage startup tackling a giant ($50B+) market. We’re supported by the smooth machinery of a Tier 1 startup studio/incubator, which complements our operational needs.
* **Ambitious.** The residential real estate sale and purchase process is broken. It’s confusing, frustrating, opaque, complicated – and it’s the largest financial transaction in most people’s lives. We’re injecting it with transparency, technology and long-waited satisfaction, for all parties involved (buyers, sellers and agents), and establishing a business model which will capture a lot of that value.
* **Thoughtful.** Our core values are transparency and rationality: we’re moving fast, but we’re investing our time wisely; we’re making big bets, but taking deliberate steps. We’ll be diligent in selecting our first designer, but we’ll make sure they are fully set up to succeed.
* **Grounded.** We’re building a business, which means making sure we deliver value for our customers fast. Monetization is not an afterthought, and we don’t depend on network effects for our product to work.

## **You Are**

* **Hungry.** Yes, you’re interested in solving human problems, building beautiful experiences, crafting a memorable brand. But above all you want to shape and participate in something early with huge potential.
* **A Learner.** You’ll bring your talent and experience to the table, but also your openness to learning and validating ideas. You know first ideas are often wrong, and that there’s nothing like user feedback to help you get on the right path.
* **Flexible.** Your interests aren’t restricted to the product or the marketing side. You’re excited to help a company get off the ground and on a growth path, and are interested in supporting both product development and marketing/sales.
* **Driven.** We’re an early stage startup. We’re starting to get some traction, but most of the work is ahead of us. Since we don’t believe in micromanaging, you’ll be trusted to be communicative and proactive in engaging with everyone on the team.
* **Systematic.** We’re deliberately keeping the team small, because we believe we can grow our customer base with a combination of strategic customer engagement and network effects. Staying small requires everyone to be systematic about their work, thinking of ways to make deliverables scale easily and adapt over time.

## **The Role**

* **Design the Product.** You’d be designing for our first product (currently a responsive web app), extending the existing design framework and developing new flows, screens and features, while solving problems for at least 4 different types of users. You’d be expected to work in increasing levels of fidelity, validating your assumptions as early as possible, and reshaping things as you learn, in close collaboration with Product and User Research, and with inclusive feedback from Engineering and Customer Acquisition.
* **Design the Message.** What we’re doing is seriously innovative, and requires a very fine-tuned message – both verbal and visual. A significant chunk of the work involves collaborating with Customer Acquisition to flesh out digital and physical collateral to get our message across and convert early adopters in multiple channels.
* **Design the Brand.** We have a solid foundation, but our company’s brand is yet to be fully articulated. You’d be expected to develop it further, making it as true to our values as possible, and to evolve it along with our product.

## **Requirements**

We know there isn’t a specific background which leads to one becoming a great designer; or that it takes a specific length of time; or the it requires the use of specific tools. We anticipate our best candidate having the following:

* Either formal design education and 2 years of design experience or at least 4 years design experience.
* Complete fluency in digital design tools (most likely Sketch, Illustrator, Photoshop and/or Balsamiq), in order to move fast.
* Experience working with engineers to ship digital products (web sites or, applications, mobile or desktop apps, etc) in some capacity.
* Understanding of basic principles and limitations of designing for the web (typography, layout, animation, performance).

## **Non-requirements**

None of the following are required for this position:

* Identification with a particular gender, race, or national origin.
* Having worked with anyone on the team before.
* A particular age.
* Sharing the same hobbies or beliefs as the other members of the team.
* A certain level of activity on a Dribbble account.
* A certain number of followers on Twitter.
