# Bold Software Engineer

We are [Bold](http://www.boldlisting.com/) and are looking for our second software engineer.  

## **Job Summary**

You’ll be working in a team on a new web application. This will involve reading, writing, deploying, and providing feedback for the code in our Javascript application. We have a React/Redux frontend and a Node backend. You should be comfortable jumping in at any point in the stack, not necessarily because you know every technology we’re currently using, but definitely using your experience as a guide. We’re actively learning from our initial product release so you’ll be helping us to learn from our users and iterate.

Since we’re just getting off the ground, we’ll also need someone to help us operationally as well as with software. You’ll be expected to understand our deployment pipeline and how the application behaves at runtime to help users with issues as they arise. We don’t necessarily expect a great deal of experience here, but we’ll be looking for at least enthusiasm to learn and some basic understanding of operations.

## **Opportunities**

These are early days in our company, so there are many opportunities to grow personally and shape the direction of the company.

* There are plenty of chances to explore new technologies and services since we’re just getting off the ground.
* Product input is welcome from anyone in the company, so if you’re interested in contributing to those discussions, we’d love to hear from you.
* The company’s culture is important to us and early employees have an opportunity to make an impact on how we grow into a strong, inclusive, and supportive place to work.

## **Responsibilities**

* Write code (with tests) for our application.
* Perform thoughtful and constructive code reviews which improve the quality of the product and the team.
* Go on-call, during which you may be called upon to diagnose and fix operational or software issues.
* Estimate complexity and deliver updates on progress to the rest of the team (engineering and beyond).
* Collaborate with designers to bring beautiful products to our customers.

## **Qualifications**

Our application is a single-page web app with a Node backend, so knowledge of Javascript is highly preferred, though not strictly required for experienced candidates with a demonstrated ability to learn new languages and environments. 

As a small company, all team members should feel a sense of ownership over their work and responsibility to quality and communication. We’ll be moving fast and so we need someone with the experience to work well independently, but we don’t want anyone on the team to be afraid to ask for help.

## **Requirements**

* At least three years writing code
* Understanding of test principles
* Demonstrated ability to learn new languages and environments
* Sense of ownership over your work 

## **Non-requirements**

None of the following are required for this position:

* Identification with a particular gender, race, or national origin.
* Having worked with anyone on the team before.
* A particular age.
* Sharing the same hobbies or beliefs as the other members of the team.
* A specific number of years having written in a specific language or framework.
* A certain level of activity on a Github account.
* A minimum reputation level on StackOverflow.

## **We Are**

* **Small.** We’re a well funded early stage startup tackling a giant ($50B+) market. We’re supported by the smooth machinery of a Tier 1 startup studio/incubator, which complements our operational needs.
* **Ambitious.** The residential real estate purchase process is broken. It’s confusing, frustrating, opaque, complicated – and it’s the largest financial transaction in most people’s lives. We’re injecting it with transparency, technology and long-waited satisfaction, for all parties involved (buyers, sellers and agents), and establishing a business model which will capture a lot of that value.
* **Thoughtful.** Our core values are transparency and rationality: we’re moving fast, but we’re investing our time wisely; we’re making big bets, but taking deliberate steps. 
* **Grounded.** We’re building a business, which means making sure we deliver value for our customers fast. Monetization is not an afterthought, and we don’t depend on network effects for our product to work.
