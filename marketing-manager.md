# Bold Marketing Manager

We’re [**Bold**](http://boldlisting.com/), and we’re looking for a great marketer.

### **We Are**
 
- **Small.** We’re a well funded early stage (~5 employees) startup tackling a giant ($50B+) market. 
- **Ambitious.** The residential real estate is broken. It’s confusing, frustrating, opaque, complicated – and hugely important in most people’s lives. We’re injecting it with transparency, technology and long-awaited satisfaction.  In addition, we are establishing a business model which will capture a lot of that value. 
- **Thoughtful.** Our core values are transparency and rationality: we’re moving fast, but we’re investing our time wisely; we’re making big bets, but taking deliberate steps.  
- **Grounded.** We’re building a business, which means making sure we deliver value for our customers fast. Monetization is not an afterthought, and we don’t depend on network effects for our product to work. 

### **Job Summary**
We are currently in private beta for a new software platform.  The team has a strong appreciation for the value of marketing expertise and we’re looking an in-house expert to work alongside sales, support, user research, product, design and engineering.  This role is for an experienced marketer who has previously managed marketing campaigns and is excited to create and build a marketing program from the ground up.   


The role will evolve as we gain product-market fit, but will involve testing messaging and the strength of various channels.  It will then build on those tests to create a marketing program that generates customer leads.  Much of the job will include managing digital channels, but as we’re a start-up and you’ll be the first full-time marketer on the team the role will also include managing non-digital channels like direct mail and events.  

### **Stage**
These are early days in our company, so there are many opportunities to grow personally and shape the direction of the company.  In addition, the company’s culture is very important to us and early employees have an opportunity to impact how we grow into a strong, inclusive, and supportive environment to work.
